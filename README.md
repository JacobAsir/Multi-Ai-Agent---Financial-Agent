# Multi-Ai-Agent---Financial-Agent

𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗜 𝗕𝘂𝗶𝗹𝘁
Using Phidata, I created a 𝗠𝘂𝗹𝘁𝗶-𝗔𝗜 𝗔𝗴𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝗦𝘆𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗺 that combines the capabilities of two specialized agents:

𝗪𝗲𝗯 𝗦𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗰𝗵 𝗔𝗴𝗲𝗻𝘁: This agent uses the Groq model (Llama3-70b) and the DuckDuckGo tool to search the web for information. It ensures that all responses include sources and are presented in markdown format for clarity.

𝗙𝗶𝗻𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲 𝗔𝗴𝗲𝗻𝘁: This agent is equipped with YFinance tools to fetch stock prices, analyst recommendations, company fundamentals, and the latest news. It uses tables to display data for better readability.

These agents were then orchestrated into a multi-agent team capable of working together to solve complex tasks. The agents collaborated seamlessly, with the web search agent pulling relevant news and the finance agent providing structured financial insights.

This project highlights the power of multi-agent orchestration in solving real-world problems. By combining the strengths of different agents, we can create systems that are more intelligent, efficient, and capable of handling diverse tasks.
